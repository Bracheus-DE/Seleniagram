/**
 * The `ConfigurationHolder` interface is designed to provide a contract for holding and managing configuration
 * data related to an application. It defines methods for retrieving and setting configuration values such as the
 * username, password, language, and API key. Implementations of this interface are expected to provide access to
 * these settings, enabling their use across the application.
 *
 * The interface includes getter and setter methods for each configuration item, ensuring that the values can be
 * easily accessed and updated. The `toString` method allows for a textual representation of the configuration
 * information.
 *
 * Implementing classes should provide the actual functionality for retrieving and storing the configuration data,
 * either from a file, a database, or some other source.
